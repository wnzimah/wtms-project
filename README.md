    -A task management and profile app for employees is called WTMS (Worker Task Management System). Through a simple and responsive Flutter interface, it enables worker members to register or log in, examine tasks that have been allocated to them, and submit work completion reports. 

    -The app would connect to a backend API made in PHP with a database in MySQL.
